# Formula 1 Project üèéÔ∏è

## Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze and predict outcomes in Formula 1 racing. The goal is to explore historical race data, driver performance, car specifications, and other relevant factors to uncover patterns and make predictions on race results, qualifying times, or championship standings.

## Project Objectives

- Data Collection & Cleaning: Gather and preprocess historical F1 data (e.g., driver stats, team data, circuit information, weather conditions).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and analyze trends, such as driver performance over time and team competitiveness.
- Feature Engineering: Identify and create features that significantly impact race outcomes.
- Model Development: Build machine learning models to predict race results, qualifying times, or championship standings.
- Model Evaluation: Compare models using metrics like accuracy, RMSE, precision, and recall.
- Visualization: Create interactive dashboards or plots for result interpretation.

## Data Sources

- Kaggle Datasets: Formula 1 datasets for race results, lap times, and driver/team information.
- Official Formula 1 Website: Supplementary data from Formula 1 Official Site.
- Weather API

Key Features

- Multiple Prediction Models: Predict race winners, qualifying times, or championship standings.
- Feature Importance Analysis: Understand which factors most influence race results.
