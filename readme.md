# Formula 1 Project üèéÔ∏è

## Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze races Formula 1 racing. The goal is to explore historical race data, driver performance, car specifications, and other relevant factors to uncover patterns and find interesting insights.

## Project Objectives

- Data Collection & Cleaning: Gather and preprocess historical F1 data (e.g., driver stats, team data, circuit information, weather conditions).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and analyze trends, such as driver performance over time and team competitiveness.
- Visualization: Create interactive dashboards or plots for result interpretation.

The main idea of the project is to create an enhanced prediction model that can accurately predict the race winners and eventually the top 10.

## Data Sources

- Kaggle Datasets: Formula 1 datasets for race results, lap times, and driver/team information.
- Official Formula 1 Website: Supplementary data from the Formula 1 Official Site.
- Weather API
- FastF1 API
